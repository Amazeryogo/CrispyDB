  "lyrics": "Wealth, fame, power.\nGold Roger the king of the pirates obtained this and everything else the\nWorld had to offer. And his dying words drove countless souls to the seas.\n“You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything I gathered\nTogether in one place. Now you just have to find it! ”\nThese words lured men to the grand line, pursuing dreams greater than they\nEver dared to imagine. This is the time known as the great pirate era.\n\nCome on board and bring along,\nAll your hopes and dreams.\nTogether we will find everything\nThat we’re looking for.\n\nOne Piece\n\nCompass left behind.\nIt’ll only slow us down.\nYour heart will be your guide.\nRaise the sails and take the helm.\n\nThat legendary place,\nThat the end of the map reveals\nIt’s only legendary,\nTill someone proves it real.\n\nThrough it all,\nThrough all the troubled time,\nThrough the heartache\nAnd through the pain.\nKnow that I\nWill be there to stand by you,\nJust like I know you’ll stand by me.\n\nSo come on board and bring along,\nAll your hopes and dreams.\nTogether we will find everything\nThat were looking for.\nThere is always room for you,\nIf you want to be my friend.\n\nWe are!\nWe are\nOn a cruise!\n\nWe are!
